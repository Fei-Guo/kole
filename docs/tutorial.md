# Instructions

This tutorial focuses on how to deploy the Kole project

## Environmental requirements

### Kubernetes Cluster

Need to create a kubernetes ahead of the cluster, here we use the [ali cloud container service](https://cs.console.aliyun.com/), provides a standard  Pro cluster.

### Emqx Cluster
Emqx clusters can be deployed on kubernetes clusters. For details about the deployment mode, see [link](https://www.emqx.com/zh/blog/rapidly-deploy-emqx-clusters-on-kubernetes-via-helm)

It is recommended that the emqx service type be LoadBalancer. The LoadBalancer service provides a public IP address (LOADBALANCE_IP). Next we will use the LOADBALANCE_IP IP。

# How to deploy

## Deploy Instructions

All of the following operations are in the kole source root directory.

##  Deploy Kole related components

Kole consists of two main components, kole-controller and lite-kubelet, as well as some CRD definitions.All related components are deployed under the namespace kole.

``` 
$ kubectl apply -f config/setup/manifest.yaml

namespace/kole created
service/kole-controller created
statefulset.apps/kole-controller created
configmap/lite-kubelet-start-signal created
service/lite-kubelet created
statefulset.apps/lite-kubelet created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/infdaemonsets.lite.openyurt.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/infedgenodes.lite.openyurt.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/querynodes.lite.openyurt.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/summaries.lite.openyurt.io created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kole created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kole-rolebinding created
```


Check out the statefulsets of kole-controller and lite-kubelet:

``` 
$ kubectl get statefulsets.apps -n kole
NAME              READY   AGE
kole-controller   0/0     92s
lite-kubelet      0/0     92s
```

Change the value of the statefulSet environment variable MQTT5_SERVER for kole-controller and lite-kubelet.

```
        env:
        - name: MQTT5_SERVER
          value: mqtt://8.142.157.229:1883
```

We need to put the `mqtt://8.142.157.229:1883` this value into the new emqx service corresponding to the public IP address: `mqtt://${LOADBALANCE_IP}:1883`

Run the following command to change the value:

```
CONTROLLER_PATCH=$(cat <<- EOF
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kole-controller
        env:
        - name: MQTT5_SERVER
          value: "mqtt://{LOADBALANCE_IP}:1883"
EOF
)

 $ kubectl patch -n kole statefulsets.apps kole-controller  --patch "$CONTROLLER_PATCH"
 
 LITE_KUBELET_PATCH=$(cat <<- EOF
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: lite-kubelet
        env:
        - name: MQTT5_SERVER
          value: "mqtt://{LOADBALANCE_IP}:1883"
EOF
)
 
$ kubectl patch -n kole statefulsets.apps lite-kubelet --patch "$CONTROLLER_PATCH"

```

## How to test


`test/script/storm.sh` is used to simulate registration tests for different node sizes. The `start` command emulates 200 pods with 10W nodes by default.

```
$ ./test/script/storm.sh start

```

To change the number of nodes and the number of pods, modify the following parameter values in the `test/script/storm.sh`  file, Then run the `start` command again。

```
POD_NUMS=`expr 200`

TOTAL_LITE_KUBELET_NUM=`expr 100000`
```

`storm.sh start` will monitors whether all pods are created. If the creation is complete, the following log is generated to record the time required for the creation of all pods: such as


```
The time required to create the last POD is *** s
```

After all the pods are created, we need to modify the configMap so that lite-kubelet in the pod triggers the registerring Node operation:

By default, lite-kubelet monitors changes in the configmap named `lite-kubelet-start-signal` under [kole] namespace, if the date of `lite-kubelet-start-signal`  changed, lite-kubelet registering hb and registering hb are automatically triggered,


```
$ kubectl get cm -n kole  lite-kubelet-start-signal -o yaml
apiVersion: v1

kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-01-27T08:29:15Z"
  name: lite-kubelet-start-signal
  namespace: kole
  resourceVersion: "4193091"
  uid: 5b9f614c-74c0-4679-8d3d-458c245b587f
  
data:
  test: start
```


We can modify the `lite-kubelet-start-signal` configmap configuration using the following command：

```
CM_PATCH=$(cat <<- EOF
data:
  test: start1111
EOF
)

$ kubectl patch -n kole cm lite-kubelet-start-signal  --patch "$CM_PATCH"
```



Continue to monitor the log generated by `storm.sh start`. If all registerring hb registers successfully and kole-controller returns an ack. a log similar to the following is output:

```
All Lite-Kubelet registrations take time to complete is *** ms

```


also, you can check the log of kole-controller to see the number of registered hosts：

```
$ kubectl -n kole logs -f kole-controller-0
```
